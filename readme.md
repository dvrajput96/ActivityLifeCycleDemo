# Activity Lifecycle Demo

## Description:
This project provides a demonstration of the activity lifecycle in Android development. It includes two activities: MainActivity and SecondActivity, where the lifecycle methods are implemented and logs are added to track the sequence of events during the lifecycle.

## Features:
- MainActivity: The main entry point of the application. It showcases the activity lifecycle and logs the lifecycle methods being called.
- SecondActivity: A secondary activity that also demonstrates the activity lifecycle and logs the lifecycle methods being called.

## Medium Article:
For a detailed explanation of the activity lifecycle and the implementation in this project, please refer to the accompanying Medium article at [Android Activity Related Queries](https://medium.com/@dvrajput96/android-activity-related-queries-ddce0a261b31).

## Github Repository:
The project source code can be found on Github at [Activity Lifecycle Demo](https://github.com/dvrajput96/ActivityLifeCycleDemo). Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the activity lifecycle.

## Requirements:
- Android Studio: Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed on your development machine.
- Android SDK: Ensure that you have the necessary Android SDK components installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have the latest JDK version installed.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dvrajput96/ActivityLifeCycleDemo.git
   ```

2. Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project."

3. Navigate to the cloned project directory and select it.

4. Wait for Android Studio to sync the project and download any necessary dependencies.

5. Once the project is successfully loaded, you can build and run it on an emulator or physical device.

## Usage:
1. Launch the application on an emulator or physical device.

2. The MainActivity will be displayed, and the logs in the Logcat will show the lifecycle methods being called at each stage of the activity's lifecycle.

3. Interact with the MainActivity by navigating through different screens or performing actions that trigger lifecycle events.

4. Similarly, navigate to the SecondActivity and observe the logs in the Logcat to see the lifecycle methods being triggered for that activity as well.

5. Use the logs to understand the sequence and timing of each lifecycle method being called for the activities.
